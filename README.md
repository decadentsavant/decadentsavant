I began learning Dart/Flutter simply as a hobby to create a mobile application I wanted to use for myself. A year later, I've fallen in love with the software development experience and am completely consumed. 
  * I've arranged my day to practice development for a few hours before and after my day job. 
  * I've attended several events and conferences in person including Firebase Summit 2022 and StackOverflow Flow State 2022. 
  * I've replaced Netflix with Youtube tutorials
